The fifth International Conference on Live Interfaces will take place at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, 9-11 March 2020. This biennial conference will bring together people working with live interfaces in the performing arts, including music, the visual arts, dance, puppetry, robotics or games. The conference scope is highly interdisciplinary but with a focus on interface technologies of expression in the area of performance. Topics of liveness, immediacy, presence (and tele-presence), mediation, collaboration and timing or flow are engaged with and questioned in order to gain a deeper understanding of the role contemporary media technologies play in human expression.  
The special theme of the 2020 conference is

#### Artificial Intelligence. Artistic Intelligence.  
#### Automated Emotional Intelligence.

A.I. is relatively widespread and ubiquitous within interfaces for artistic expression. 
Within this domain we can also include various sorts of automation and algorithmic extensions, 
as this consitutes a form of external agency that allows us to do more. 
To do more than we could unassisted by these technologies. How does this affect the artistic expression? 
Is it a merely convenience and an affordance to allow us to interface to complex domains, 
and such just extend our inherent abilities. Or, does it imply a deeper impact on how the art is made? 
We can assume that all interfaces affect what we can do in profound ways. 
The difference with A.I. and machine learning in general is that the internal workings of the algorithms to 
a larger extent is a black box. We understand to a lesser degree how the internals of neural networks actually work, 
and then, how do we understand what we do as artists with these interfaces?

We are especially proud to announce **[Rebecca Fiebrink](https://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/homepage/)** as a keynote speaker!
Rebecca Fiebrink teaches Computing at Goldsmiths University of London as a Senior lecturer. Her research includes machine learning,
Human-computer interaction (among more), in particular in the development of new digital instruments and gestural interfaces.
Rebecca developed the Wekinator, an open source software that enables machine learning in the context of artistic and musical performances. It allows users to build a human-computer interaction without writing code, offering a new form of accessibility. Rebecca is also involved in the creation of interactive technologies for digital humanities research and machine learning education.

### Collaboration with Meta.Morf
This ICLI collaborates with the [Meta.Morf](http://metamorf.no/) biennal for art and technology, taking place in Trondheim from March 3 to May 5. The Meta.Morf opening week is 5-10 March, and ICLI will commence immediately after. This creates a special opportunity to spend some quality time in Trondheim, in the company of both the ICLI and the Meta.Morf crowd. ICLI attendees will get a discount on Meta.Morf tickets. The theme for Meta.Morf 2020 is "The digital wild" - bending and twisting our illusions about digital futures. Come stay a full week in Trondheim and get the best of both worlds.


### Corona virus information <a name="corona"></a>
ICLI monitors the situation regarding the spread of Corona, and we will follow any public (institutional, national, international) policies that are put in effect.
Currently there are no policies recommending cancellation of the event.
In ICLI as in other events where we meet other people, standard precautions are recommended regarding hand hygiene (good hand wash and alcohol rub) and respiratory hygiene (using a tissue to cover your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing).
Here are the [guidelines from The Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/op/novel-coronavirus-facts-advice/facts-and-general-advice/advice-and-information-to-public/)
We will have hand disinfectant and information posters at the venue.
