ICLI is an interdisciplinary conference focusing on the role of interfaces in all artistic performance activities. 
This biennial conference will bring together people working with live interfaces in the performing arts, including music, the visual arts, 
theatre, dance, puppetry, robotics or games. The conference scope is highly interdisciplinary but with a focus on interface technologies of 
expression in the area of performance. Note that technologies here can be understood in the widest possible sense. Topics of liveness, immediacy, presence (and tele-presence), 
mediation, collaboration and timing or flow are engaged with and questioned in order to gain a deeper understanding of the role contemporary 
media technologies play in human expression.
