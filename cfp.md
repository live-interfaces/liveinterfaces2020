## Technical info for performances and installations:
The performances and installations will be staged in a concert venue. 
A good PA system appropriate for the hall is installed, and a decent set of microphones, lines, monitors, lights etc as one would expect for a professional concert venue. 
The technical rider should inform which equipment is needed to allow for a smooth procedure during sound check.
The conference can not provide any specialized equipment other than that commonly found in a concert venue for music. Also, the conference can not provide performers for composed pieces etc. 
The submission of works to the conference implies that you will bring what you need of personell and special equipment to perform or install the piece.
