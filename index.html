<p>Artificial Intelligence. Artistic Intelligence. Automated Emotional Intelligence. 
A.I. is relatively widespread and ubiquitous within interfaces for artistic expression. Within this domain we can also include various sorts of automation and algorithmic extensions, as this consitutes a form of external agency that allows us to do more. To do more than we could unassisted by these technologies. How does this affect the artistic expression? Is it a merely convenience and an affordance to allow us to interface to complex domains, and such just extend our inherent abilities. Or, does it imply a deeper impact on how the art is made? We can assume that all interfaces affect what we can do in profound ways. The difference with A.I. and machine learning in general is that the internal workings of the algorithms to a larger extend is a black box. We understand to a lesser degree how the internals of neural networks actually work, than how we understand more transparent interfaces. So, getting to know the interface intimately takes on other types of challenges. to be able to play e.g. a musical instrument, we can assume that it helps understanding how the interface works. Be it the keys of a piano, the bow of a violin, or the nuances of the human voice. Working with automation and algorithms, we also assume that getting to know the workings and the outputs of the algorithm is necessary to bee able to harness its creative potential. Many algorithms of automation are relatively transparent, even if the layering of several levels of automation can to some degree be alienating. With neural networks and other A.I. technologies even the experts of the field sometimes have problems relating the exact inner workings. So how do we enable ourselves to effectively use these means of expression? Perhaps we can on some level liken it to the process of getting to know another human being in personal and artistic relations? In that context there are also hidden layers that affect interaction and communication. Then, looking at the actual technologies of artificial intelligence, could it be corrent to say that these are very much based on an instrumental cold logic? Optimization procedures that are a necessary part of how these algorithms work (how they learn and how they execute) tend to narrow down the available complexity. In many cases, reduction of complexity is part of the goal. Then for artistic work, is this actually a good thing? for In the making of artworks, with their plurality of possible meanings and interpretations, is it artistically productive to reduce this complexity? In the increasing automation of processes in society, ...from selfdriving cars to recommendations for movies and music, from social media filtering algorithms to political control agendas, from automated medical diagnostics to blockchain trust-making... how is our freedom of agency in the world arouns us affected? How does this chenge the way we make art. What responsibilities do we have for critical implementation? Is art responsible for producing a counterbalance to the optimization technologies? How can this be done. Deeply technological questions of algorithms and implementation are mixed with philosophical, anthropological and social questions in this - our tomorrows parties.
