### Call for papers [Deadline expired]

International Conference on Live Interfaces is a biennal conference hosted to bring together people working with *live interfaces* in the performing arts, including music, the visual arts, dance, puppetry, robotics or games.

The special theme of 2020 is **Artificial Intelligence. Artistic Intelligence. Automated Emotional Intelligence**. However, the call was open to all topics concerning live interfaces, not only to this year's special theme. The following text was provided as inspiration:

*A.I. is relatively widespread and ubiquitous within interfaces for artistic expression. Within this domain we can also include various sorts of automation and algorithmic extensions, as this constitutes a form of external agency that allows us to do more â€“ more than we could unassisted by these technologies. How does this affect the artistic expression? Is it merely a convenience and an affordance to allow us to interface to complex domains, and as such just extend our inherent abilities? Or, does it imply a deeper impact on how the art is made? We can assume that all interfaces affect what we can do in profound ways. The difference with A.I. and machine learning in general is that the internal workings of the algorithms to a larger extent is a black box. We understand to a lesser degree how the internals of neural networks actually work, and then, how do we understand what we do as artists with these interfaces?*


### Open call for reflections on interfaces: *What is an interface to you?* [Deadline expired]

ICLI 2020 will be hosted around the same time as Meta.Morf, a biennal in Trondheim focusing on arts and technology. As part of ICLI's submission to the Meta.Morf 2020 festival catalogue, we invited people to submit short reflections on the diversity of interfaces. A selection of these entries will be published in the Meta.Morf catalogue, and will later be published here.
