***Live Interfaces 2020 Open Call: A diversity of interfaces.***

- Short reflections. What is an interface to you?  

 

We are looking for a diverse focus on what interfaces can be, and invite submissions to help explore this idea.

You are welcome to submit poetry, metaphors or any other text form that relates to interfaces, in any language.

A selection of these entries will be curated and printed in the ICLI part of The Meta.Morf 2020 Festival catalogue.

Send your reflections in 1 - 1000 characters to liveinterfaces@gmail.com.

Deadline 25/10
